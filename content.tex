\subsection{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
 \item 
  'Brain stimulation is increasingly used in clinical settings'
 \item
  stimulation protocols not optimized
 \item
  link control theory and brain modelling to predict the effect of stimulation 
 \item
  FitzHugh Nagumo vs Wilson-Cowan
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methods}

Quickly recapitulate 
\begin{itemize}
 \item 
  FitzHugh Nagumo
 \item
  Oscillatory transition parameters
 \item
  Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)
 \item
  Linear network control theory
 \item
  Functional and structural effect, fractional activation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reproduction of experiments}

\begin{itemize}
 \item 
  Replicate Figure 2 ( b),c) and d) ), 3 states of the FitzHugh Nagumo and comparison to the Wilson-Cowan in b),
  and for c) our box plots for all subjects, and d) bar plots with our data
  
 \item
  Replicate Figure 3 

 \item
  Replicate Figure 4 c) 
  
 \item
  Replicate Figure 5 a)-d)
  
 \item
  Replicate Figure 6 (?)
\end{itemize}

I don't think we need to repicate Figure 7 (Structure-function landscape)

\subsection{Reimplementation}

\begin{itemize}
 \item 
  Details on the new implementation (packages/dependencies, other stuff?, maybe just a paragraph in the methods section) 
\end{itemize}

 
\end{itmeize}



\subsection{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
 \item 
  Main similarities and differences between our and original results. Replication: full, partial or not at all?
\end{itemize}
