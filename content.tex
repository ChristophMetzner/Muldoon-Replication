\subsection{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
 \item 
  'Brain stimulation is increasingly used in clinical settings'
 \item
  stimulation protocols not optimized
 \item
  link control theory and brain modelling to predict the effect of stimulation 
 \item
  FitzHugh Nagumo vs Wilson-Cowan
\end{itemize}

Transcranial electrical and magnetic stimulation  (TES and TMS, respectively) have been increasingly used in clinical studies over the last decades. TES
for example has been used to enhance memory consolidation by boosting slow-wave oscillations in deep sleep \cite{}, and to ...insert another prominent example...
\cite{}.

Furthermore, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has shown remarkable results in the treatment of tremor symptoms in Parkinsons diesease \cite{} and also great potential 
in the treatment of psychiatric disorder such as obsessive-compulsive disorder \cite{}.

However, despite this growing success in clinical settings, a principled understanding of the effects of stimulation on the dynamical processes in the brain 
is still lacking. 



\subsection{Methods}

Briefly recapitulate 
\begin{itemize}
 \item 
  FitzHugh Nagumo
 \item
  Oscillatory transition parameters
 \item
  Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)
 \item
  Linear network control theory
 \item
  Functional and structural effect, fractional activation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reproduction of experiments}

\begin{itemize}
 \item 
  Replicate Figure 2 ( b),c) and d) ), 3 states of the FitzHugh Nagumo and comparison to the Wilson-Cowan in b),
  and for c) our box plots for all subjects, and d) bar plots with our data
  
 \item
  Replicate Figure 3 

 \item
  Replicate Figure 4 c) 
  
 \item
  Replicate Figure 5 a)-d)
  
 \item
  Replicate Figure 6 (?)
\end{itemize}

I don't think we need to repicate Figure 7 (Structure-function landscape)

\subsection{Reimplementation}

\begin{itemize}
 \item 
  Details on the new implementation (packages/dependencies, other stuff?, maybe just a paragraph in the methods section) 
\end{itemize}

 




\subsection{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
 \item 
  Main similarities and differences between our and original results. Replication: full, partial or not at all?
\end{itemize}
